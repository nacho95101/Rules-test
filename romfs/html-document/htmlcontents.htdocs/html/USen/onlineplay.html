                        <p>The mod uses a <span>LAN</span> server in order to handle the Online Play status view, kicks, stats and other stuff.

                        <p>In order to tell your console appart from others, a unique console ID is used through all <span>Project_Gamblitz</span> Server communications.

The ID is a hash derived from a series of other console unique IDs tied to your NAND chip (since it is a hash, it cannot be used in reverse to obtain your private IDs). You can treat the <span>"Gamblitz"</span> Console ID as your "friend code" specific for the mod.<br><br>You have the option to get your <span>"Gamblitz"</span> Console ID on the first boot with the mod, if you choose to not create it, you won't be able to play Online with people that have their ID.</p>
